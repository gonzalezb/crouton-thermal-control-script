# crouton-thermal-control-script
I created this script for the Toshiba Chromebook 2 it may work on other Chromebooks but im not 100% sure if it does not work it most likely cant find temp data. If thats the case please open an issue and tell me your temp directory
--------------------------------------
Example:<br>
/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/device/temp2_input<br>
/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/device/temp3_input<br>
There will be a temp_input for each processor core so make sure you tell me all of your temp_input files.
